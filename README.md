This repository is the official implementation of the AIED 2024 paper entitled "Teaching and Measuring Multidimensional Inquiry Skills using Interactive Simulations" written by [Ekaterina Shved](https://people.epfl.ch/kate.kutsenok?lang=en), [Engin Bumbacher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yu5GSC4AAAAJ&hl=en), [Paola Mejia-Domenzain](https://people.epfl.ch/paola.mejia?lang=en), [Manu Kapur](https://www.manukapur.com) and [Tanja Käser](https://people.epfl.ch/tanja.kaeser/?lang=en). 

Uploaded experimental materials and source codes correspond directly to the experimental methodology mentioned in the paper. 

## Project overview

Our project expands existing research by exploring various inquiry strategies beyond the Control of Variables Strategy (CVS). We incorporate additional relevant strategies like exploring variable ranges and conducting experiments under optimal conditions. We conducted a study involving 161 chemistry apprentices who were randomly assigned to instructional conditions or a control group. Participants engaged in experimentation using an interactive simulation, with instruction focusing on either data collection or data interpretation.

Using a multi-step clustering method, we identified four distinct student profiles of inquiry strategies. Our findings suggest that combining strategies is more effective for conceptual learning than utilizing them individually. Students instructed on data collection showed increased use of strategy combinations, particularly emphasizing the Control of Variables Strategy (CVS).
